## üéØ The Challenge & Our Solution

Modern retailers struggle to get quick insights from their vast and varied data (transactions, reviews, images). The **AI Marketing Co-pilot** solves this by providing an intelligent, conversational interface to BigQuery. It allows non-technical users to ask complex questions in plain English and receive comprehensive, multimodal answers in seconds, dramatically accelerating the insight-to-action cycle.

## ‚ú® Key Features

* **Natural Language to SQL Engine:** Translates user questions into complex, multi-table SQL queries on the fly.
* **Hybrid AI Core:** Strategically combines native **BigQuery ML** (for scalable K-Means clustering) with the **Gemini API** (for dynamic reasoning and generation).
* **Multimodal Perception:** Can analyze product **images** in conjunction with text **reviews** and structured **transaction data** to provide a complete 360-degree view.
* **BQML Integration:** Intelligently generates and executes `ML.PREDICT` commands to leverage the pre-trained customer segmentation model.
* **Secure & Reproducible:** Uses Kaggle Secrets for Service Account authentication, ensuring the notebook is secure and easy for judges to run.
